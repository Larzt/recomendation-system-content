Generative AI is redefining how students learn and teachers teach. With the help of adaptive algorithms and machine learning models, this technology can create personalized learning materials, quizzes, or even interactive simulations. Imagine an AI tutor that adjusts explanations based on your progress or automatically generates practice tests tailored to your weaknesses. Generative AI enhances both engagement and accessibility, allowing education to be more inclusive and efficient. Teachers benefit too, as AI can automate grading and content creation, freeing time for meaningful interactions. The future classroom will blend human guidance with smart, generative systems.
