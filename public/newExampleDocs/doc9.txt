The historical context of the Age of Exploration marks a turning point in global society. Driven by curiosity and ambition, European civilizations expanded across oceans, connecting distant cultures for the first time. While this era fueled trade, innovation, and the exchange of ideas, it also brought colonization and exploitation. The legacy of this period is complex: it gave birth to globalization but also reshaped indigenous worlds forever. From maritime navigation to the spread of languages and religions, the Age of Exploration reminds us how human progress often carries both light and shadow in equal measure.
